PROJECT 3a STOCK DATA VISUALIZER

there is no compose file as i could not figure out how to get that to work with our dependencies so you have to manually compose

instructions:
1. clone repo onto computer
2. open docker
3. cd into project folder
4. use the following commands in project folder (I think those are the right commands I can't find my history):
5. docker build -t project3a .
6. docker run -p 5000:5000 project3a
7. this should get the docker container up and running and host the site on localhost:5000
